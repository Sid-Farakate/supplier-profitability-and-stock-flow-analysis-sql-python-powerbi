## Overview

This project evaluates supplier performance and retail inventory dynamics to drive strategic insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization.  
A complete data pipeline was built using **SQL** for ETL, **Python** for analysis and hypothesis testing, and **Power BI** for visualization.

---

## Business Problem

Effective inventory and sales management are critical in the retail sector.  
This project aims to:

- Identify underperforming brands needing pricing or promotional adjustments  
- Determine supplier contributions to sales and profits  
- Analyze the cost-benefit of bulk purchasing  
- Investigate inventory turnover inefficiencies  
- Statistically validate differences in supplier profitability  

---

## Dataset

- Multiple CSV files located in `/data/` folder (sales, suppliers, inventory)  
- Summary table created from ingested data and used for analysis  

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (Common Table Expressions, Joins, Filtering)  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)  
- **Power BI** (Interactive Visualizations)  
- **GitHub**  

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Removed transactions with:  
  - Gross Profit â‰¤ 0  
  - Profit Margin â‰¤ 0  
  - Sales Quantity = 0  
- Created summary tables with supplier-level metrics  
- Converted data types, handled outliers, merged lookup tables

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Negative or Zero Values Detected:**  
- Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)  
- Profit Margin: Min -âˆž (sales at zero or below cost)  
- Unsold Inventory: Indicating slow-moving stock  

**Outliers Identified:**  
- High Freight Costs (up to 257K)  
- Large Purchase/Actual Prices  

**Correlation Analysis:**  
- Weak between Purchase Price & Profit  
- Strong between Purchase Qty & Sales Qty (0.999)  
- Negative between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)
